## Struggles
I got very discouraged when I ran into some issues with the current version of .NET, which I didn't manage well. When I got that working, I ran into more issues getting the app deployed to Azure, so I decided to present on my localhost.

## Next Version
I'd like to add a good deal of styling as well as the ability of the user to add tags to a listing and a log of steps and/or repairs in the garment construction process

## What I learned
I learned that taking extended time off from programming can really set me back by not practicing the skill. I also learning the value of time management and expecting roadblocks when making a schedule.
